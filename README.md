## About

This is a simple pong game that I made to practice python and learn
pygame.

## How to Run

Run the following in the command in the pong-game directory 
to start the game:

``` sh
python3 -m main
```


## How to Play

After running the main script, select 1-player or 2-player mode
from the main menu. The player controls their paddle with the
up and down arrow keys. If in 2-player mode, the other player controls
their paddle with the W and S keys.

Thanks to *Clear Code*!

This project was originally based on his tutorial at

although nearly all of the original code has been rewritten by now, and new features added.
